## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## ğŸš€ Run with Docker

You donâ€™t need to install Bun manually. Just build and run the app with Docker:

```bash
sudo docker build -t 10ms-task .
sudo docker run -p 3000:3000 10ms-task
```
